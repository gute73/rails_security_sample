<h1>About</h1>

<p>This Rails app serves one purpose, and one purpose only: to quickly and cleanly illustrate that I understand how to create a secure app that protects users login information and only allows users to view information that they are authorized to see. The app was not intended to be particularly attractive. If you want a better idea of my CSS skills, please see my portfolio at <a href="http://markdking.me">http://markdking.me</a> or some of my other web apps in <a href="https://github.com/gute73">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The goal here is to simulate an online environment where users can have free or paid accounts. Those with free accounts can only view posts but are not allowed to make posts of their own. In addition, the names of the authors of indivdual posts are hidden from users with free accounts. These features become unlocked for users with paid accounts.  Please note that there is no index page for users, no option to edit or delete accounts, no admin access, no mechanism for signing up for a paid account, etc. The focus here is on the implementation of password security and the management of permissions.</p>
